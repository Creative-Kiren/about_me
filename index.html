<h3>Time for a change</h3>

	<p>
	Having worked in HR for 10+ years and when my last employment was made redundant, I decided I needed to take stock of my experience and what skills I can add to HR career.  During my career, I always have a natural gravitas towards systems and wanted to expand on this. Having spoken to different friends and colleagues, I realised there is a shortgage of coders.  Not having much of an idea what this meant, I did a "little" research and concluded I should start with front-end web development.  Who knows, this could lead to a change in career. 
</br>
</br>
	So here I am embarking on a new interest.  A little scared, frustrated and anxious but my experience in HR has made me resilient so I will be fighting my through to getting it.  Watch this space....
